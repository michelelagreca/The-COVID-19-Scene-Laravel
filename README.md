# The COVID-19 Scene
This project is a website made as final project of the course of Web Programming that I followed in the Bachelor Degree of Computer Engineering with the Prof. Simone Palazzo.<br><br>
The COVID-19 Scene is a platform developed for a correct and useful approach to the new COVID-19 Pandemic. This website uses some functionalities used in another project called COVID-19 Management System. This project is available [here](https://github.com/michelelagreca/COVID-19-Management-System). The website and the database are used together to create the final platform.<br><br>
